1) Software-Modules
===================
Checkout the following modules from https://github.com/backmeup/
These are currently required to build a fully functional BackMeUp instance

 - backmeup-indexer
 - backmeup-ui
 - backmeup-plugins
 - backmeup-service
 - backmeup-storage
 - backmeup-worker
 - backmeup-keyserver
 
2) Setting up BackMeUp
======================
A) In %tomcat_home%/conf modify tomcat-user.xml settings. Within the <tomcat-users> section add:
  <role rolename="manager"/>
  <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
  <role rolename="manager-script"/>
  <role rolename="admin"/>
  <role rolename="admin-gui"/>
  <user password="admin" roles="admin,admin-gui,manager,manager-gui,manager-script" username="admin"/>


B) adjust %maven_home%/conf/settings.xml
Within /conf/settings.xml make sure to add the following configuration within the 
BackMeUp's maven configuration autodeploys servlets to Tomcat.
<server>
      <id>backmeup.keyserver.tomcat</id>
      <username>admin</username>
      <password>admin</password>
    </server>

    <server>
      <id>backmeup.keyserver.postgres</id>
      <username>dbu_keysrv</username>
      <password>dbu_keysrv</password>
    </server>

    <!-- Backmeup Service -->
    <server>
      <id>backmeup.service.tomcat</id>
      <username>admin</username>
      <password>admin</password>
    </server>
 
	<!-- Backmeup Worker -->
    <server>
      <id>backmeup.worker.tomcat</id>
      <username>admin</username>
      <password>admin</password>
	</server>

	<!-- Backmeup Indexer -->
    <server>
      <id>backmeup.indexer.tomcat</id>
      <username>admin</username>
      <password>admin</password>
	</server>
	
	<!-- Backmeup Storage -->
    <server>
      <id>backmeup.storage.tomcat</id>
      <username>admin</username>
      <password>admin</password>
    </server>


D) Building the backmeup-keyserver component
--------------------------------------------
D1. adjust backmeup-keyserver-core/src/main/resources/backmeup-keyserver.properties
here you can decide either to use the embedded Derby database or postgres configuration for running the keyserver. Default is Derby. To use postgres:
# BACKMEUP KEYSERVER ----------------------------------------------------------

#backmeup.keyserver.db.connector = org.backmeup.keyserver.core.db.derby.DerbyDatabaseImpl
#backmeup.keyserver.db.driver_name = org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver
#backmeup.keyserver.db.connection_string = jdbc:derby:keyserver;create=true

# for postgres:
backmeup.keyserver.db.connector = org.backmeup.keyserver.core.db.sql.SQLDatabaseImpl
backmeup.keyserver.db.driver_name = org.postgresql.Driver
backmeup.keyserver.db.connection_string = jdbc:postgresql:keyserver?user=keyserver_user&password=keyserver

and do not modify the other lines within the properties file.

If you're using postgres copy the contents from backmeup-keyserver-sql-postgres.properties (template file) into 
backmeup-keyserver-sql.properties

D2. connect to postgres on port 5432 and create the keyserver's database + db user
create a database user called 'keyserver_user' (pw 'keyserver')
create a database called 'keyserver' and assign the keyserver_user as owner

D3. configuring setup for integration tests
Wihin backmeup-keyserver-tests/src/test/resources/integrationtests.properties the backmeup.keyserver.integration.baseuri is required.
backmeup.keyserver.integration.baseuri = http://localhost:8080/backmeup-keyserver-rest
Make sure the configuration (port!) matches your local installation or specify a different instance for running the integration tests. 

D4. Allow Oracle JDK to support AES 265 bit encryption. See FAQ>B for further details

D5. make sure tomcat is running. To deploy the keyserver call
mvn install -DintegrationTests

Info:
Note that every redeployment a truncate is called on the database and the keyserver's database gets dropped.


E) Building the backmeup-indexer component
------------------------------------------
Follow the installation and deployment guide which is provided in
backmeup-indexer>readme.rm


F) Building the backmeup-service component
------------------------------------------
F0. Make sure you've installed RabbitMQ + Erlang dependency, set the %ERLANG_HOME% user variable and started the message queue calling sbin/rabbit-mq-server.bat

F1. connect to postgres on port 5432 and create the component's database + db user
create a database user called 'dbu_core' (pw 'dbu_core')
create a database called 'bmucore' and assign the dbu_core user as owner

Info:
Make sure this information is reflected within src>main>resources>META-INF/persistence.xml

F2. Modify the properties file in backmeup-service-rest under src/main/resources/backmeup.properties 
Set the values for the backmeup.osigi.deploymentDirectory, temporaryDirectory and backmeup.job.temporaryDirectory, callbackUrl, backmeup.service.appSecret, etc. 
For a local installation you're fine to keep all default ones.

# PLUGINS ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Location for the backmeup plugin bundles that will be loaded at startup
backmeup.osgi.deploymentDirectory = /data/backmeup-service/autodeploy
# Temporary directory for OSGi container
backmeup.osgi.temporaryDirectory = /data/backmeup-service/osgi-tmp
backmeup.osgi.exportedPackages = org.backmeup.plugin.spi org.backmeup.model org.backmeup.model.spi org.backmeup.plugin.api.connectors org.backmeup.plugin.api.storage com.google.gson org.backmeup.plugin.api org.backmeup.plugin.api.actions javax.mail com.sun.imap
# --------

F3. Within backmeup-service-tests check src/test/resources/integrationtest.properties and adjust to your local tomcat settings if you don't operate on the default ports

F4. To deploy the the component switch into backmeup-service root and call
mvn -DintegrationTests pre-integration-test
OR
mvn install -DintegrationTests -DskipTests
(Note: skipTests is recommended, as most of the integration tests do not properly cleanup and are likely to corrupt the database)

F5. To check if the component is properly working switch to backmeup-service-tests and run the integration tests
e.g. manually JUnittest in Eclipse
src/test/java/org.backmeup.tests.integration/UserIntegrationTests.java testAddUser()
(Note: as most of the integration tests do not properly cleanup and are likely to corrupt the database.)

F6.within backmeup-service/autodeploy directory you'll find the created osgi bundles + their dependencies which are required to run the plugin-framework. This includes the osgi blueprint bundles, etc.. 
Copy all bundle jars into data/backmeup-service/autodeploy and data/backmeup-worker/autodeploy [according to the configuration in section F2] 

J) Building the backmeup-storage component
-----------------------------------------
Backmeup Storage provides a central storage location for files and a REST-API to interact with.
J1. switch to backmeup-storage and edit backmeup-storage-service/src/main/resources/backmeup-storage.properties to match your configuration. 

J2. To deploy the component call 
mvn install -DintegrationTests

J3. within backmeup-storage/autodeploy directory you'll find the created osgi bundles + their dependencies which are required to run within osgi plugin-framework.
Copy all bundle jars into data/backmeup-service/autodeploy and data/backmeup-service/autodeploy [according to the configuration in section F2] 

G) Building the backmeup-plugins
--------------------------------
To build the plugins call
mvn install

* within the backmeup-plugins/autodeploy directory you'll find the created osgi bundles + their dependencies. 
Copy the plugins you want to deploy into data/backmeup-service/autodeploy and data/backmeup-worker/autodeploy [according to the configuration in section F2] 

Info:
Note: all backmeup plugins should have proper osgi bundle dependency resolving. Make sure to copy all dependencies from the autodeplyo folder into the osgi lookup directory -> check the log files after deployment. Some dependencies are exposed for all bundles and some are embedded for the individual plugins.
Plugins with require app secrets for using the providers API (e.g. as Facebook), you need to manually alter the plugin's .jar file and insert the app secret and keys or use Jenkins for managing the configuration. 

Certain Plugins as e.g. the Facebook Plugin also require to have a Facebook-App registered at developer.facebook.com which manages the Canvas URLS as https://apps.facebook.com/bmu_themis


H) Building the backmeup-worker component
-----------------------------------------
H1. switch to backmeup-worke and edit backmeup-worker-app-servlet/src/main/resources/backmeup-worker.properties to match your configuration. 

H2. To deploy the servlet call 
mvn install -DintegrationTests

Info: to check the worker's proper deployment and status call
http://localhost:8080/backmeup-worker-app-servlet/

* As abackmeup-worker may run on a seperate machine, it needs to have all plugins + bundles available. 
Take all jar-files from data/backmeup-service/autodeploy [according to the configuration in section F2] and copy them to 
data/backmeup-worker/plugins which is the autodeploy directory (according to the connfiguration in H1] of the backmeup-worker. 

-> check FAQ hint F for debugging.


I) Building the GUI
-------------------
Using the UI locally does not require to have a http server up and running.
* pre-compiled applications for iOS and Android is located in backmeup-ui/appfiles
* a version optimmized for a desktop browser is located in  backmeup-ui/app.extern.gtn.themis/www

Configure the UI and select against which Themis backend you want to run it

I1. change into the folder app.extern.gtn.themis/www_debug/plugin/ and open the file plugin.WebServiceClient.json to connect to your local backmeup backend
----------------------------------------------------------------
"first": 
			{
				"scheme": "http",
				"scheme_specific_part": "://",
				"host": "localhost",
				"port": 8080,
				"path": ""
			},
----------------------------------------------------------------


I3 To deploy the Themis UI into the / root of your tomcat server simply switch to backmeup-ui and call
mvn install –DintegrationTests 

OR

I3.2 copy this directory into your Apache2.2 htdocs folder when using a http-server
But then make sure to kill all open Chrome browser instances and launch Chrome with disabled-web-security as cross-domain requests won't work.

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --disable-web-security
open the file in your browser
file:///D:/repositories/themis-backmeup/backmeup-ui/app.extern.gtn.themis/www/page/start.html

I4. Within the GUI navigate to Settings > clear appdata to remove all cached entries in the browser's database

===========
FINALLY
===========
Point your browser to localhost:8080 and enjoy Themis/Backmeup

FAQ
===
A) Windows/Linux
----------------
Currently both platforms are supported. Due to dependencies on the underlying file system based encryption mechanisms (LUKS, Truecrypt container creation, etc.), it is possible that Windows support will be dropped/limited in future.

B) Oracle JDK - AES 265 bit encryption
----------------
Oracle JDK is only able to support encryption up to AES 128 bit by law. As the BackMeUp system relies on AES 265 bit symetric key encryption it is required to download and install updated policy files for the JVM. see:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6538485/java-using-aes-256-and-128-symmetric-key-encryption 
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html
Hint: How to find out which JRE is beeing used on your system: http://kb.froglogic.com/display/KB/Finding+the+JRE+that+executes+a+Java+application

C) Enabling remote Tomcat server debugging in Eclipse
---------------
see http://blogs.mulesoft.org/debugging-your-tomcat-webapp-with-eclipse/
modify the server's start configuration and add
-Xdebug
-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=n
In Eclipse go to Run>Debug Configurations -> Remote Java Application -> New
Chose the project, add localhost and port 8000 -> apply -> debug
Now you're able to "debug as -> junit test"

D) Adjusting Permsize
----------------
The default value for Tomcat7 is set to 64m and is to low. Add the following values to the server's startup configuration and make sure you don't have any blanks at the end of the line
-XX:PermSize=256m
-XX:MaxPermSize=512m 

E) wget for Windows
----------------
Wget is available for Windows (32bit or 64bit version). It allows to issue GET/PUT/POST/DELETE requests. For example to check if the keyserver is properly working create a user (id 1, password (sd) by running 
wget.exe -post-data '' http://localhost:8080/backmeup-keyserver/users/1/asd/register

F) check the rabbitmq message queue
----------------------------------
To start the rabbitmq_server in management mode got to rabbitmq setup dir/sbin and call
'rabbitmq-plugins.bat enablemq_management'
when this is completed restart the queue with rabbitmq-server.bat
to check on the status of the queue go to http://localhost:15672/ username/pw: guest/guest
when running the first backup you should find a 'keyserv' and 'backmeup' message queue.

G) Apache Tika in Server Mode
----------------------------------
The Indexing Plugin relies on Apache Tika for advanced object identification, metadata and fulltext extraction
The Plugin does not provide the apache Tika bundle itself [mainly due to stability caused by ignored and missing artefacts in the bundle] but requires to have an Apache Tika Server running locally on localhost:9998 to issue the calls.

To provide the JAX-RS webservice of Tika, go to https://github.com/willp-bl/ProcessIsolatedTika
A pre-configured version with Tika 1.7 is already provided in backmeup-plugins/backmeup-indexing-plugin src/main/resources/processisolatedtika-0.0.4-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
To launch Tika call:
java -jar processisolatedtika-0.0.4-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
